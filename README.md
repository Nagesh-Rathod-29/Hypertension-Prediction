# Hypertension-Prediction
This is a web application which can predict whether the person is suffering from hypertension or not using predictive model(ANN). 


### What is hypertension ?

A condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high.
Usually hypertension is defined as blood pressure above 140/90, and is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120.
High blood pressure often has no symptoms. Over time, if untreated, it can cause health conditions, such as heart disease and stroke.
Eating a healthier diet with less salt, exercising regularly and taking medication can help lower blood pressure.

## Symptoms
Most people with hypertension don’t feel any symptoms. Very high blood pressures can cause headaches, blurred vision, chest pain and other symptoms. 

Checking your blood pressure is the best way to know if you have high blood pressure. If hypertension isn’t treated, it can cause other health conditions like kidney disease, heart disease and stroke.

People with very high blood pressure (usually 180/120 or higher) can experience symptoms including:

severe headaches
chest pain
dizziness
difficulty breathing
nausea
vomiting
blurred vision or other vision changes
anxiety
confusion
buzzing in the ears
nosebleeds
abnormal heart rhythm
If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and a high blood pressure, seek care immediately.

The only way to detect hypertension is to have a health professional measure blood pressure. Having blood pressure measured is quick and painless. Although individuals can measure their own blood pressure using automated devices, an evaluation by a health professional is important for assessment of risk and associated conditions.

### Treatment

Lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure.

#### These include:

eating a healthy, low-salt diet
losing weight
being physically active
quitting tobacco.
If you have high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend one or more medicines. Your recommended blood pressure goal may depend on what other health conditions you have. 

Blood pressure goal is less than 130/80 if you have:

cardiovascular disease (heart disease or stroke)
diabetes (high blood sugar)
chronic kidney disease
high risk for cardiovascular disease.
For most people, the goal is to have a blood pressure less than 140/90. 

### There are several common blood pressure medicines: 

ACE inhibitors including enalapril and lisinopril relax blood vessels and prevent kidney damage.
Angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) including losartan and telmisartan relax blood vessels and prevent kidney damage.
Calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and felodipine relax blood vessels.
Diuretics including hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone eliminate extra water from the body, lowering blood pressure.
Prevention
Lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure and can help anyone with hypertension. Many who make these changes will still need to take medicine. 

### These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure. 

#### Do:

Eat more vegetables and fruits.
Sit less.
Be more physically active, which can include walking, running, swimming, dancing or activities that build strength, like lifting weights.
Get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity.
Do strength building exercises 2 or more days each week.
Lose weight if you’re overweight or obese.
Take medicines as prescribed by your health care professional.
Keep appointments with your health care professional.
#### Don’t:

eat too much salty food (try to stay under 2 grams per day)
eat foods high in saturated or trans fats
smoke or use tobacco
drink too much alcohol (1 drink daily max for women, 2 for men)
miss or share medication.
Reducing hypertension prevents heart attack, stroke and kidney damage, as well as other health problems.

### Reduce the risks of hypertension by:

reducing and managing stress
regularly checking blood pressure
treating high blood pressure
managing other medical conditions.
Complications of uncontrolled hypertension
Among other complications, hypertension can cause serious damage to the heart. Excessive pressure can harden arteries, decreasing the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. This elevated pressure and reduced blood flow can cause:

chest pain, also called angina;
heart attack, which occurs when the blood supply to the heart is blocked and heart muscle cells die from lack of oxygen. The longer the blood flow is blocked, the greater the damage to the heart;
heart failure, which occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to other vital body organs; and
irregular heart beat which can lead to a sudden death.
Hypertension can also burst or block arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, causing a stroke.

In addition, hypertension can cause kidney damage, leading to kidney failure.

### Hypertension in low- and middle-income countries

The prevalence of hypertension varies across regions and country income groups. The WHO African Region has the highest prevalence of hypertension (27%) while the WHO Region of the Americas has the lowest prevalence of hypertension (18%).

The number of adults with hypertension increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, with the increase seen largely in low- and middle-income countries. This increase is due mainly to a rise in hypertension risk factors in those populations.
